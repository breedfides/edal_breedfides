## eDAL - electronic Data Archive Library ###

### This is the new repository for the e!DAL-API ###

We created a new repository, because the structure of the API was changed to a multi-build project using the gradle build tool
```
gradle build
```
For more information about the API visit our [project website](http://edal.ipk-gatersleben.de/)
